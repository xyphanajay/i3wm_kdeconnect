# i3wm_kdeconnect
Mini scripts to lock, login, reboot, sleep, power off, open browser, pcman etc.


These scripts can be only used on i3wm. You can execute them kde-connect.


I started them for that purpose only. It can be extended for other operating systems and integrated to a single script.

## NOTE
Do update password in logger script.

## Help yourself and others as well :-)
